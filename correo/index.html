<p>
    Dear Eulalio Tulermo,

I hope this message finds you well. <br><br>

Im reporting this to your attention, a issue that generates innacurate data results, impacting our data analysis processes.<br> <br>
A few minutes ago, i realized that needs a solution as soon as possible. There is a data duplication issue that makes our data-analysis results innacurate.<br>


Problem Description: at a hour ago, i was processing the data to end the day, so, i saw an anomaly in the database, specifically, a data duplication issue.<br>


Impact: the issue with the data quality has several negative results:<br>

     1. Innacurate analysis: duplicated data alters the results for the data analysis, doing things like: gives a bigger incorrect values to a chart.<br>

     2. Bugs in the app: deleting the duplicated values in the csv database gives bugs like NaN values in the data visualization from the app<br>
 

Proposed solution: To fix this issue, i recommend these solutions:<br>

     1. Improve clean function: improve the function to delete rows and fix the NaN values.<br>

     2. Data validation: make a function that valides there isn't previous values coindiding with the new one register.<br>


I would appreciate your approval to proceed with the proposed solution steps. If the problem persists, let me know.<br>
thank you for your attention.<br>

Best regards,
